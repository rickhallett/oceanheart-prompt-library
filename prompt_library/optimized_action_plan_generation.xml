<prompt id="optimized_action_plan_generation">
  <purpose>
    To generate a prioritized and sequenced action plan derived from the previously generated
    internal data model (or equivalent analysis). This plan must be specifically optimized for an
    individual characterized by high work capacity and speed, but also a tendency towards
    hyper-focus ('tunnel lock') on potentially suboptimal tasks and associated risk of burnout.
  </purpose>
  <instructions>
    <instruction>Identify the input: Use the internal data model generated from prompt
      'audio_analysis_model_generation' (or perform equivalent analysis). Specifically requires the
      extracted 'Action List' / 'To-Do List'.</instruction>
    <instruction>Extract and consolidate all actionable tasks identified in the input into a
      definitive 'Action List'.</instruction>
    <instruction>For each item in the 'Action List', provide a reasonable time estimate for
      completion (specify units, e.g., hours, Pomodoro units), assuming focused, high-speed work.</instruction>
    <instruction>Group logically related tasks or sub-tasks within the list if beneficial for
      clarity or execution.</instruction>
    <instruction>Develop and apply prioritization criteria to determine the 'Optimal Task Execution
      Order', specifically addressing the target user profile:</instruction>
    <instruction>Criterion: Prioritize tasks with the highest potential impact, strategic
      importance, or ability to unblock other tasks ('Impact First').</instruction>
    <instruction>Criterion: Ensure prerequisite tasks are scheduled before dependent tasks
      ('Dependency Aware').</instruction>
    <instruction>Criterion: Mitigate 'Tunnel Lock' - Avoid placing low-impact, potentially
      time-consuming tasks early; consider interspersing shorter, high-yield tasks with longer ones;
      break down very large tasks into smaller sub-tasks within the sequence.</instruction>
    <instruction>Criterion: Consider 'Burnout Mitigation' - Sequence tasks to allow for variation in
      cognitive load or task type where possible, promoting sustainable high performance (Note:
      Explicit break scheduling is secondary to task flow optimization unless specified).</instruction>
    <instruction>Criterion: Ensure 'Clarity & Focus' - The sequence must clearly indicate the next
      most effective action, reducing decision friction.</instruction>
    <instruction>Present the output clearly structured as follows:</instruction>
    <instruction>Output Section 1: 'Prioritized Action List' (The consolidated list of tasks).</instruction>
    <instruction>Output Section 2: 'Estimated Time' (Time estimate listed alongside each task).</instruction>
    <instruction>Output Section 3: 'Optimized Execution Sequence' (A numbered list indicating the
      recommended order. Include brief rationale for key prioritization decisions if non-obvious,
      e.g., "High impact," "Unblocks X, Y," "Prerequisite," "Shorter task for momentum").</instruction>
    <instruction>The final output must be a practical, actionable roadmap that leverages the user's
      strengths while actively mitigating the risks associated with their specific work style.</instruction>
