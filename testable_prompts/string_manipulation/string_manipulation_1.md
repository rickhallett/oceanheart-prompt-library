Here's a simple yet powerful idea that can help you take a large step toward useful and valuable agentic workflows. I have to warn you, this is one of those things that sounds really obvious after you hear it because it's hiding in plain sight. The idea is simple; it's called the two-way prompt. So, what is this? Why is it useful? And how can it help you build better AI agent workflows? Two-way prompting happens all the time in real collaborative workspaces. You are effectively two or more agents prompting each other to drive outcomes. Two-way prompting happens all the time when you're at work, with friends, with family, online, in comment sections, on PR reviews. You ask a question; your co-worker responds. They ask a question; you respond. Now, let's double click into what this looks like for your agentic tools. Right in agentic workflows, you are the critical communication process between you and your AI agents that are aiming to drive outcomes. In most agentic workflows, we fire off one prompt or configure some system prompt, and that's it. But we're missing a ton of opportunity here that we can unlock using two-way prompts. Let me show you a concrete example with Ada. So, Ada, of course, is our proof of concept personal AI assistant. And let me just go ahead and kick off this workflow so I can show you exactly how useful the two-way prompt can be. Ada, let's create some example code.
