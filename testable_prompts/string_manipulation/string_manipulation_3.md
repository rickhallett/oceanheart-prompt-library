SCRIPT
Here's a simple yet powerful idea that can help you take a large step toward useful and valuable agentic workflows. I have to warn you, this is one of those things that sounds really obvious after you hear it because it's hiding in plain sight. The idea is simple; it's called the two-way prompt. So, what is this? Why is it useful? And how can it help you build better AI agent workflows? Two-way prompting happens all the time in real collaborative workspaces. You are effectively two or more agents prompting each other to drive outcomes.
