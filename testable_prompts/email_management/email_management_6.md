Project Update - New Requirements and Timeline Changes
From:

Hi Dan,

I wanted to provide an update on the ERP system implementation project. After our last meeting with the client, they have requested some additional features and changes to the original requirements. This includes integrating with their existing CRM system, adding advanced reporting capabilities, and supporting multi-currency transactions.

Due to these new requirements, we will need to adjust our project timeline and milestones. I estimate that these changes will add approximately 3-4 weeks to our original schedule. We should also plan for additional testing and quality assurance to ensure the new features are working as expected.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about these changes. I think it's important that we communicate this to the client as soon as possible and set expectations around the revised timeline.
